===================

UPDATE: As of Fall 2017, we are actively updating the People Roadmap through listing sessions and online discussion. If you have ideas to add to the Roadmap, please visit [talk.beta.nyc](https://talk.beta.nyc/c/roadmap) and add your ideas!


This is the People's Roadmap to a Digital New York City landing page. For the past year, the BetaNYC community has met and worked on this document to properly frame how technology should be build. You can comment on this document via [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_hN-syKJPIfPicXfuhIlcf55SrbwJLM0rTkLrmx-Be4/edit?usp=sharing).

If you find issues with the code or language, please [file an issue](https://github.com/BetaNYC/peoples-roadmap-nyc/issues).

Note that branch `gh-pages` is what shows on production http://NYCroadmap.us. Master is old, very, very old.

#How to Code for this Repo
 * Option A: Fork, Edit, then Pull Request when ready.
 * Option B: If in the BetaNYC brigade and you have write access to repo: Develop/test in your own branch, preferablly a feature-named-branch, and once it's ready for production, merge into gh-pages, which auto deploys to GitHub pages for BetaNYC.org

Also, it's nice if you merge/commit to gh-pages, that you [let the team know in the #ops-roadmap Slack channel](http://slack.beta.nyc).
